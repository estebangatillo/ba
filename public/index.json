[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Activities are designed to be as interactive as possible. Students are asked to participate in each lesson. Lessons are divided between K-5 (primary), 6-8 (middle) and 8-12 (high)\nPrimary school lessons\nBecome a Beaver This lesson demonstrates adaptations beavers evolved to live a semi-aquatic life:\n Features for swimming Traits for building dams Qualitites for chewing through trees  These traits make beavers one of the most efficient ecosystem engineers in the world.\nFind the Beaver Ambassador slide show [here]. Other programs have devised similar lesson plans as well:\n Buffalo Bill Center of the West Colorado Parks and Wildlife North Carolina Parks via Worth a Dam  Endangered Species of Oregon This lesson introduces ESA legislation and helps to answer these questions:\n What is the Endangered Species Act? How does it help endangered or threatened plants and animals? What animals in Oregon are on the Endangered species list? Who decides how and what plant or animal to add to the list? What can we do to help?  Basic Ecological Models This lesson demonstrates how to visualize relationships and interactions between biotic and abiotic components within a wetland [insert figure].\nBuilding models is a foundational element of conceptual thinking, so this lesson can work exceptionally well with any science unit educators are currently teaching (i.e. decomposition cycles, forests, bacteria, etc.)\nSensory Scavenger Hunt Adapted from a similar activity developed by Friends of the Tualatin River Wildlife Refuge. This activity gives students the task of experiencing nature by locating plants and animals using different senses like hearing, smelling, seeing and touch. [insert example]\n[link to friends of TRNWR example]\nHigh school lessons\nIntroduction to GIS Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is an important tool for ecologists and can be used in many different, complex ways. High school students can benefit from an early introductory lesson to GIS, how some professionals use GIS and what students can do with GIS tools.\nWildlife Management Students are asked to solve conflicts created by urban wildlife at a city park within West Linn, Oregon. A scenario was provided with constraints that reflect the way city administrators perceive related issues. Students were asked to consider in their solution things like cost, feasibility and community response.\nField Sampling Methods Students conduct quadrat and transect sampling methods as a field exercise where they learned random sampling methods, percent canopy cover and basic plant identification. Transect and quadrat sampling was compared to sampling using the app iNaturalist which records single observations of all living things.\nIntroduction to Excel using Biodiversity Indicies Students are introduced to equations designed to analyze biodiversity. Both Shannon’s and Simpson’s Biodiversity Indices are explained. Concepts including relative abundance, evenness, and richness are described. Students use their own collected data (or otherwise generated data) to develop a spreadsheet that solved for Shannon’s and Simpson’s Diversity Index. Basic excel skills are used in developing the spreadsheet.\n","date":1566259200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1566259200,"objectID":"59c3ce8e202293146a8a934d37a4070b","permalink":"/courses/example/","publishdate":"2019-08-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/example/","section":"courses","summary":"Lessons adapted and/or written by Beaver Ambassadors","tags":null,"title":"Lesson plans","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"NOAA (National Oceanic \u0026amp; Atmospheric Administration) is a leading federal environmental organization.

They\u0026rsquo;ve evolved together, right here in the Pacific Northwest, for thousands of years. Beaver dams DO NOT prevent fish passage. Unlike human-made dams, fish can get around beaver dams in a variety of ways. People who generated the myth that beavers are bad for fish were likely trying to find ways to justify exploiting beaver pelts and/or falsely blaming decreased fish populations on beavers.\nThe vast majority of published, peer-reviewed science articles about relationships between beavers and salmon show beavers provide habitat for salmon.\nImagine you are a young salmon. It takes you about a year to get to the ocean. In that time you move from the place you were born constantly going downstream. You need lots of food and protection on your journey. You find some bugs (called macroinvertebrates) in the stream, but it\u0026rsquo;s tough to hang out in the current and the bugs tend to be in shallower areas - easy to get eaten by an osprey! Then you come across a beaver dam! The current slows, food is abundant AND easy to reach and there are plenty of sticks and logs to hide under! What a perfect place to hang out and bulk up for the rest of the journey downstream.\nNow you\u0026rsquo;ve successfully navigated the great Pacific Ocean and you\u0026rsquo;re ready to return to Oregon\u0026rsquo;s rivers to reproduce. The current on the Columbia and Willamette is swift! You have to go through countless fish ladders because of all the dams people built (maybe you\u0026rsquo;re shot out of a fish cannon). You\u0026rsquo;re one of the lucky ones and you make it to a side stream off the Tualatin River, and lo! A beaver dam. It is spring and the waters are running over the dam, so you simply SWIM UP and voila! You can take a nice, deserved break! The flow has slowed, the pond is huge, and there is plenty of refuge to hide from predators - bears, owls, eagles. You hang out for a few days, regain your strength and head on to the headwaters where you\u0026rsquo;ll drop eggs in areas known as redds.\nHundreds of years ago, salmon would have encountered dozens of beavers dams, each one more welcome than the last. It is entirely likely the decrease in salmon populations is affected by the decrease of beavers.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t take my word for it\u0026hellip;.\nUS Forest Service biologists and watershed scientists have determined beavers DO NOT impede native fish passage\nBeavers are mentioned 232 times! in the Official Coho Recovery Plans written by NOAA Fisheries. I particularly like how the authors point out the importance of habitat complexity and provide examples of how habitats become complex including, \u0026ldquo;Beaver provide considerable help in providing this connection and in maintaining proper watershed functioning in Oregon coast streams.\u0026rdquo; Authors go on to include strategies to improve habitat, and the second strategy is: \u0026ldquo;Ensure long-term ecosystem functions and high quality habitat by reducing habitat-related threats and encouraging formation of beaver dams and beaver dam analogues.\u0026ldquo;\nBeavers benefit threatened populations of Steelhead and this relationship was shown right here in Oregon! One of the greatest beaver models ever made was published in this scientific paper (it is less complex than it looks, just follow the arrows and see all the + signs!):\nSo don\u0026rsquo;t take my word for it\u0026hellip;check out these links!

At Mary S. Young Park.\nThe Beaver Ambassadors project began at Mary S. Young Park in West Linn because of the incredible accessibility people have to view, experience, and understand beavers and their activity. Beavers built a home where a cement trail intersects their pond! They come out at almost the same time every day – 8pm. You can go see them on your own. However, the Beaver Ambassadors will be on location Tuesday nights throughout the summer (unless noted otherwise). We want the community to meet the beavers! We can learn from so much from this amazing species. For those community members who have found the trail conditions challenging or the loss of trees disheartening I encourage you to come out to meet us! We’ve been working to find a balance, but managing this species brings unique challenges. We love to hold dialogues with anyone who shows interest, we’re open to suggestions, and we love collaborative solutions! Plus, we’ll probably see a whole lot more. Beavers create homes for all sorts of other plants and animals.\nWhat \u0026amp; Where: Meet the Beavers at Mary S. Young Park\nWhen: Last one of the summer!

The goal was to determine how the forest canopy community might shift as a result of beaver activity. We took tree species and location in Mary S. Young Park in West Linn along Heron Creek:\nOf all records accumulated, 31% were stumps:\nMore statistical analysis should be completed, but results appear to show Oregon White Oak (Quercus garryana) thrives in this area:\nOregon White Oaks have the ability to flourish in floodplains where Doug Fir fail to survive root inundation. Ash, maple, and cottonwood can flourish in floodplains as well, but these species are preferred food source for Oregon beavers. Could it be that beavers promote Oregon White Oak habitat in riparian areas? Literature fails to adequately address this question. Oregon White Oak habitat is among the most degraded in the nation with only 2% remaining from the range prior to European occupation. Agricultural development and loss of native communities are frequently cited as the major drivers behind the loss of white oak ecosystems. This work suggests beavers played a role in these dynamics as well. However, much more work needs to be done to prove this hypothesis! MSY is but one small region, and more sites need to be assessed to help determine a relationship. In the mean time, Parks \u0026amp; Rec management will use this finding to continue to promote white oak growth. Oaks are protected by beaver herbivory, and water levels are encouraged to increase within the forest to help choke out conifers.
