      <description>&lt;p&gt;Beaver Ambassadors started in West Linn, Oregon, as a way to increase awareness around our community about beavers that live in West Linn and why this species is so important to the natural ecosystem. We work with schools, organizations, individuals, and volunteers around parks and at community events to celebrate and promote the function of beavers in our parks and rivers. The systems beavers create are so much more than beaver ponds for beavers! Trees, amphibians, fish, mammals, people, and all life benefits from beavers just doing there thing.&lt;/p&gt;
