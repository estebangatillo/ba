      <description>&lt;p&gt;Beaver Ambassadors started in West Linn, Oregon, as a way to increase awareness around our community about beavers that live in West Linn and why this species is so important to the natural ecosystem. Since then, we have expanded to cover all types of ecological topics. We work with schools, organizations, individuals and volunteers around parks and at community events to celebrate and promote natural function of our parks, forests and rivers. Ecosystems beavers build are so much more than beaver ponds for beavers! Trees, amphibians, fish, mammals, people, and all life benefits from beavers just doing their thing.&lt;/p&gt;
