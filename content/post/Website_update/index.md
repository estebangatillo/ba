# Welcome to the new look at BA!


## We have more options

[Better linking](http://web.pdx.edu/~scm6/westlinn_leaflet.html) to cool apps we've made for the community

We can more easily manipulate text `like highlighting`.

## For advanced users [perhaps in R](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/managing-content/#create-a-blog-post)

We can add snippets of code you could add to your project, or help you start your own!

```bash
leaflet() pipe
  color = blue
  addMarkers = etc
```

## Inserting pictures

![spirea_bee](/img/spirea_bee.jpg)

We have _way_ more capabilities in terms of adding albums and linking to other cool pictures, but for now here is a picture of a bumble bee on spirea!


## Stay tuned!
