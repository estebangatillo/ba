In a little follow up to our last post about salmon and beaver interactions, here we share research out of the Great Lakes area. Kathryn Renik released a [masters thesis](https://www.bemidjistate.edu/directory/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2018/03/Thesis.-2019-Renik-K..pdf) in August 2019 from Bemidji State University in Minnesota. The question addressed has gotten much press in the region - how do beaver and brook trout interact? Complexity of this issue increases around misunderstandings (migrating fish CAN and DO move around beaver dams) and the fact that brook trout are not native to Renik's study area, but they have become important to fishing people of the area.

The bottom line is that beavers and fish have coexisted for thousands of years. Our streams ran 100% *FULL* of salmon prior to European occupation and these same streams were *STUFFED* with beavers.

Now we changed the system. We want to say what is and isn't important. When things go against what we thought we knew we publish articles [like this](https://news.orvis.com/fly-fishing/beavers-good-bad-trout-might-surprised). They should change the headline to "Yeah, we're wrong and still slow at admitting it". I love how [this article](https://www.twincities.com/2019/08/26/damming-question-can-beaver-and-trout-coexist-we-dont-know-yet/) even explains that western states (that's us here in Oregon) have been faster to understand the important role beaver play in salmon habitat, but the title seems misguided still...

Renik highlights this lack of understanding. "There was an obvious lack of empirical data and/or experimental controls within the reviewed studies, which we suggest emphasizes the need for more data-driven Beaver-salmonid research in  the WGL [Western Great Lakes] region." Renik goes on to explain the difficulties in analyzing this issue: "Resource  managers are routinely faced with an ecological dilemma between maintaining natural environmental processes within   cold-water ecosystems and conducting Beaver control for the benefit of salmonids, and this dilemma is further complicated when the salmonids in question are a non-native  species." Beaver control for the benefit of salmoids is not accurate. Salmonids benefit from beaver activity. Non-native salmon might behave differently because they, duh, don't belong there. Empirical data on this issue is incredibly difficult as timing and spatial factors complicate data collection. We're happy to see Renik add to our understanding. We hope academia builds from Renik's research and these ecological relationships become better understood.
