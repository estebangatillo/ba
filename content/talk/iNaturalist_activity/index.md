iNaturalist helps you identify plants and animals around you. The app establishes a connection with a community of over 750,000 scientists and naturalists who can help you learn more about nature! By recording and sharing your observations, you’ll create research quality data for scientists working to better understand and protect nature. iNaturalist is a joint initiative by the California Academy of Sciences and the National Geographic Society. 

iNaturalist is relatively easy to use, but a few simple techniques will improve iNaturalist community response, photography skills, and your ability to connect with nature all around. A two hour training session will help you learn these skills then we’ll go out and apply what we learn!

This activity is divided into two sections: a training session and a field session. The training session is two hours. The first hour is an introduction to iNaturalist and the second hour will focus on plant identification with web tools. Identification includes an introduction to photography as good subject photography is a key to identification and confirming your observations.

The field session will be about two hours. We will be in Mary S. Young State Park where we’ll photograph and post images of plants and animals. If you are familiar with iNaturalist we encourage you to join us for the field session. If you would like to improve nature photography skills we encourage you to attend both sessions.
