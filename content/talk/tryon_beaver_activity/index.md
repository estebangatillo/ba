FOR A SPECIAL LAST SATURDAY TREAT, WANDER INTO ONE OF OUR CLASSROOM DISCOVERY DAYS.

Usually reserved for more formal programs like camp and field trips, our nature classroom opens its doors on the last Saturday of every month with fun and educational hands-on activities for visitors of all ages.  This open-house style program has a ‘come and go as you please’ format, so feel free to drop by anytime during the hours listed above.
