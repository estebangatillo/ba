Here is info for the Journey cover band performing this Thursday:


Portland based Journey tribute, “Girl Can’t Help It,” will have you Captured from Arrival to Departure, staying true to the original recordings with lead singer Miaya Shambry’s gritty powerhouse vocals, Dan Johnson slayin’ the guitar solos, Natasha Flynn’s timeless piano/synth hooks, Dianna Hnatiw driving deep on drums, and April Krubel bringin’ it, backing up the signature three part female harmonies that make this band’s unique take on old Journey favorites.
