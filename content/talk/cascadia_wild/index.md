This Friday! Join us for an evening of mystery and intrigue and support a
local, community-based nonprofit.

MYSTERY TRACKS: AN ANIMAL WHODUNIT TO BENEFIT CASCADIA WILD
Friday, December 06th | Event at 6:45 pm, Doors at 6 pm @ Jean's Farm, SE Portland OR

WAS IT MRS. MARTEN IN THE WOOD OR COLONEL FOX IN THE MEADOW?
Put your animal sleuthing skills to the test! Answer the who, where, and
why of animal tracks â€“ who left them, where they were, and what they were
doing. Whether you're new to tracking or an expert, you're guaranteed to
learn about wildlife and have fun, while investigating plaster track casts
created by naturalist Steve Engel. You'll have the option to purchase clues
to help uncover the trail, and prizes will go to the highest-scoring teams!

YOUR TICKET INCLUDES: Wood-fired pizza (GF and vegan options), seasonal
beer, non-alcoholic refreshments, and other light fare. Sliding scale, but
we ask a minimum $10 to help cover event costs.

ALL PROCEEDS DIRECTLY BENEFIT CASCADIA WILD. From the Wolverine Tracking
Project, to our classes and clubs, to keeping the lights on, we are a
volunteer-run, community-supported organization. We thank everyone in
advance for their support and hope to see you for what promises to be a
night of education, fun, and mystery!
