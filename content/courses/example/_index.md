Activities are designed to be as interactive as possible. Students are asked to participate in each lesson. Lessons are divided between K-5 (primary), 6-8 (middle) and 8-12 (high)


**Primary school lessons**

## Become a Beaver

This lesson demonstrates adaptations beavers evolved to live a semi-aquatic life:

* **Features for swimming**
* **Traits for building dams**
* **Qualitites for chewing through trees**

These traits make beavers one of the most efficient *ecosystem engineers* in the world.

Find the Beaver Ambassador slide show [here]. Other programs have devised similar lesson plans as well:

* [Buffalo Bill Center of the West](https://centerofthewest.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Animal-Adaptations_Dress-A-Beaver-Activity.pdf)
* [Colorado Parks and Wildlife](https://cpw.state.co.us/Documents/Education/TeacherResources/MediaKitsCrates/Durango-Beaver-Adaptations-Lesson-Plan.pdf)
* [North Carolina Parks via Worth a Dam](https://www.martinezbeavers.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/build-a-beaver-outline.pdf)




## Endangered Species of Oregon

This lesson introduces ESA legislation and helps to answer these questions:

* What is the Endangered Species Act?
* How does it help endangered or threatened plants and animals?
* What animals in Oregon are on the Endangered species list?
* Who decides how and what plant or animal to add to the list?
* What can we do to help?


## Basic Ecological Models

This lesson demonstrates how to visualize relationships and interactions between biotic and abiotic components within a wetland [insert figure].

Building models is a foundational element of conceptual thinking, so this lesson can work exceptionally well with any science unit educators are currently teaching (i.e. decomposition cycles, forests, bacteria, etc.)


## Sensory Scavenger Hunt

Adapted from a similar activity developed by Friends of the Tualatin River Wildlife Refuge. This activity gives students the task of experiencing nature by locating plants and animals using different senses like hearing, smelling, seeing and touch. [insert example]

**High school lessons**


## Introduction to GIS

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is an important tool for ecologists and can be used in many different, complex ways. High school students can benefit from an early introductory lesson to GIS, how some professionals use GIS and what students can do with GIS tools.



## Wildlife Management

Students are asked to solve conflicts created by urban wildlife at a city park within West Linn, Oregon. A scenario was provided with constraints that reflect the way city administrators perceive related issues. Students were asked to consider in their solution things like cost, feasibility and community response.



## Field Sampling Methods

Students conduct quadrat and transect sampling methods as a field exercise where they learned random sampling methods, percent canopy cover and basic plant identification. Transect and quadrat sampling was compared to sampling using the app iNaturalist which records single observations of all living things.



## Introduction to Excel using Biodiversity Indicies

Students are introduced to equations designed to analyze biodiversity. Both Shannon’s and Simpson’s Biodiversity Indices are explained. Concepts including relative abundance, evenness, and richness are described. Students use their own collected data (or otherwise generated data) to develop a spreadsheet that solved for Shannon’s and Simpson’s Diversity Index. Basic excel skills are used in developing the spreadsheet.
