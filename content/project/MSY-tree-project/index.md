From 2017 to 2018 we sampled 465 large (greater than 5 meters tall) trees and stumps created by beaver activity. The goal was to determine how the forest canopy community might shift as a result of beaver activity. We took tree species and location in Mary S. Young Park in West Linn along Heron Creek:

Of all records accumulated, 31% were stumps:

More statistical analysis should be completed, but results appear to show Oregon White Oak (_Quercus garryana_) thrives in this area:

Oregon White Oaks have the ability to flourish in floodplains where Doug Fir fail to survive root inundation. Ash, maple, and cottonwood can flourish in floodplains as well, but these species are preferred food source for Oregon beavers. Could it be that beavers promote Oregon White Oak habitat in riparian areas? Literature fails to adequately address this question. Oregon White Oak habitat is among the most degraded in the nation with only 2% remaining from the range prior to European occupation. Agricultural development and loss of native communities are frequently cited as the major drivers behind the loss of white oak ecosystems. This work suggests beavers played a role in these dynamics as well. However, much more work needs to be done to prove this hypothesis! MSY is but one small region, and more sites need to be assessed to help determine a relationship. In the mean time, Parks & Rec management will use this finding to continue to promote white oak growth. Oaks are protected by beaver herbivory, and water levels are encouraged to increase within the forest to help choke out conifers. Weâ€™ll keep an eye on this site to further assess changes related to beaver activity.
